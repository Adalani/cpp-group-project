##Instructions for using vitrual machine and mysql server

#I installed manjaro linux in two flavours
#1: deepin desktop environment 
#2: i3wm, if your machine has less resources as it is fast and doesn't eat ram. It is a little harder to use but the keybindings
#   Displayed on the "Desktop"

open machine in vmware workstation

username = group
password = group

#mysql

#root
username = root
pass= group

#team
username = team
pass = qwerty

#To start mysqld (i3wm)

press windows key + enter to open terminal

#to start mysql(deepin)
go to dock click terminal app to to open terminal

#start server:

systemctl start mysqld

#verify server is active

systemctl status mysqld
 
# if you get permission error in terminal use:

sudo <command>

#sudo grants super user privileges. 
#
#All group files are in:
~/github/cpp-group-project

##I have installed VSCode for you as text editor. 
#if you cant find vscode, go to TERMINAL and type

code &
#use amersand as is puts the process in the background  if you need to continue using that terminal. If not, omit ampersand.

#COMPILE
To compile the code, use the flags that are commented into the top of the .cpp file. 

## If you are going to test the program after compile, make sure MySQLd is running or you get error!
##

## DOn't remember if i installed git or not,
## if not, open terminal and type:

sudo pacman -S git
